      <h1>Talks</h1>
      <p>Despite not having much development experience under my belt, I've noticed that there's been a great number of people wanting to pivot into tech. I love talking about my experience of taking a non-traditional path into tech, and if hearing my journey helps even just one person, it will have all been worth it. </p>

          <h4>25th April, 2021</h4>
          <p>"Having grown up in a family involved in healthcare, Susan followed into the path of pharmacy but realised that it wasn't her passion.

            She decided to dive into a bootcamp for software development at Le Wagon having tried out the free Harvard courses. She fell hard for programming and is now working as a software developer for Octopus Deploy!

            Listen to her experience of switching careers through a bootcamp and realising pharmacy wasn't it for her."</p>
